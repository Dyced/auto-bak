AutoBackup Version 0.2

GITHUB -  https://github.com/Dyced/auto-bak

#######Config file#######
autobackup.conf

The config file will hold all variables and settings needed. If you want this to backup custom folders, they can be added in the autobackup.conf file.

By default this will go to a folder in /home/ called backup.

####SH script####

The variable to set your command for compression has been added, as well as a variable for flags, so there is a bit more control over what it spits out, and how it compresses.
